# hey there, im Liv 👋

Sorry to break it to you, but I dropped out of my computer science degree cause I started to hate programming. 😢 YET I'm still obsessed with lots of IT shit, usually cause some policy, or policy draft, or generally somthing political annoys me. 🌱 By day im studiying humans or rather whats inbetween them. 💬 If you care, feel free ask me about it. 🙃 You'll find me and my handle on mastodon and telegram (I consider both social media). 📫 

🧭 **CURRENTLY** I'm hacking together WordPress themes + plugins, with the goal of sucking less than existing ones. 

🪐 **PREVIOUSLY** I did commit some shit C#, learned a little C, hacked away with Python, entered a love/hate relationship with CSS and dealt excessively with WordPress, to a point where I know quite well what im doing.

💡 Besides "computer stuff" **I LOVE TO CREATE** music, graphics and photography. ⚡ Take a look at my [website](https://decided.to) for a quick glance. 🪜 Last but not least, I have an uncontrollable love for emojis. 🥺 I'm sorry 🥲 but not that much. 😏
